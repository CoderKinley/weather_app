Simple Weather App
This is a simple weather application built using Flutter. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays it using visually appealing Lottie animations. It also utilizes the Geolocator package for fetching the user's current location and the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API for reverse geocoding the location to a human-readable address.

Features
Real-time Weather Data: Get the current weather information for your location.
Geolocation: Automatically fetches the user's current location.
Reverse Geocoding: Converts latitude and longitude into a readable address using Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.
Beautiful Animations: Weather data is displayed with Lottie animations for a visually appealing experience.

API Integration
OpenWeather API
This app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. The API provides real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Nominatim OpenStreetMap API
The Nominatim API is used for reverse geocoding, converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.

Geolocator
The app uses the Geolocator package to fetch the user's current geographic location.
